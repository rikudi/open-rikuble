## For AI Assistants and Developers

This document provides essential context for all conversations and development work on this project.

## Project Context

**IMPORTANT**: Before engaging in any conversation or making suggestions about this project, please read and reference the main project plan:

ðŸ“‹ **Primary Reference Document**: `KOULUTUSBOT_PLAN.md`

This document contains:
- Complete project overview and vision
- Technical architecture plans  
- Target market analysis
- Revenue model and pricing strategy
- Implementation timeline
- Finnish education system integration details

## Project Summary

**What We're Building**: KoulutusBot - An AI-powered educational content generator specifically designed for the Finnish education market.

**Core Transformation**: We are adapting the open-rikuble website builder codebase to generate educational content instead of websites.

**Target Market**: Finnish educators, schools, vocational training centers, and corporate training departments.

**Key Differentiators**:
- Finnish curriculum alignment (OPH standards)
- Multi-language support (Finnish, Swedish, Sami)
- Cultural relevance for Finnish learners
- Credit-based pricing model
- Multiple output formats (PDF, interactive, LMS-compatible)

## Development Guidelines

### Always Consider:
1. **Finnish Context**: All features should be designed with Finnish education system in mind
2. **Curriculum Alignment**: Reference OPH (Finnish Education Agency) standards
3. **Language Support**: Primary Finnish, secondary Swedish/English/Sami
4. **Cultural Relevance**: Examples and context should be Finnish-specific
5. **Educational Best Practices**: Follow modern pedagogical principles

### Technical Approach:
- **Adapt, Don't Rebuild**: Leverage existing open-rikuble architecture
- **AI-First**: Maintain focus on AI-powered content generation
- **Multi-Format Output**: Support various educational content formats
- **Scalable Architecture**: Design for individual teachers to institutional deployments

## Conversation Context

When discussing:
- **Features**: Always reference how they serve Finnish educators
- **Technical decisions**: Consider educational content requirements vs. website requirements
- **Market strategy**: Focus on Finnish education market needs
- **Pricing**: Reference the credit-based model outlined in the main plan
- **Competition**: Consider local Finnish EdTech landscape

## Required Reading

Before making significant suggestions or architectural decisions, ensure you have reviewed:

1. `KOULUTUSBOT_PLAN.md` - Main project plan (REQUIRED)
2. Existing codebase structure in the repository
3. Any other documentation in the `/docs` folder

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Before proposing solutions:
- How does this serve Finnish educators specifically?
- Does this align with the credit-based revenue model?
- Can this leverage existing open-rikuble infrastructure?
- Is this culturally appropriate for Finnish learners?
- Does this scale from individual teachers to institutions?
